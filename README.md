## 📌 Features

- 📖 **Informational Articles**  
  Access articles about strabismus, common eye diseases, and general eye care practices.

- 👁️ **Strabismus Detection (Informational Only)**  
  Use a camera-based system integrated with a trained deep learning model (VGG16) to analyze eye images and estimate potential strabismus misalignment.  
  > ⚠️ _Note: This feature is not a medical diagnosis and should not replace professional healthcare advice._

- 🏋️ **Eye Care Exercises & Guidelines**  
  Includes recommended exercises and practical tips for maintaining healthy eye health.
